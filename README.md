# Aequos

The repository contains the development files for the client Aequos. The site is live at aequos.co.uk.
The files include HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with some JQuery) files as well as a phpmailer form and its required files. In addition, images have been created inhouse in 22Design or bought through the appropriate channels.

The site uses Google Analytics, flexbox for CSS and HTML5 pages. In addition, there is a chatbot installed that communicates with visitors. The css and js files have been minified to improve the performance of the site but the original versions are included in the repository.

External contribution is not allowed.
