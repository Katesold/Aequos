						<p class="grid__text">With increasing budgetary constraints, and the need to deliver better service with less resource, public sector organisations are under continual pressure to maximise efficiency. That coupled with enabling the digital workplace, more demanding users and the need for a 24x7 Digital Citizen experience means network services must adapt.  We have provided a number of public sector organisations assistance in adopting the correct WAN technology. Whether this is migrating wholescale from MPLS to adopting the right Hybrid SD-WAN strategy, our team provides thought-leadership and valuable insight. We factor in key architectural principles without compromising on the end to end security requirements and core building blocks of the organisation; whether in Local or central government. </p>

						<h3 class="grid__title"><span> Healthcare</span> </h3>
						<p class="grid__text">The delivery of Healthcare is about to change beyond recognition. The industry is changing and becoming increasingly dependent on new technology to improve efficiency and productivity.  The acceptance of cloud based technologies is uniting the way in which organisations are transforming the way they treat patients through the use of connected devices to core business applications. Nevertheless, cloud services in healthcare are considered high-risk for security breaches. Healthcare organisations must therefore adapt to the changing profile and deliver a WAN that meets both patient and business needs.
Our team acts for a wide range of clients, including NHS trusts and private care providers.</p>

						<h3 class="grid__title"><span> Retail</span> </h3>
						<p class="grid__text">The Retail industry faces a common problem with varying regional geographies, differing connectivity requirements per location for their distributed stores. Companies within the retail sector face unique connectivity challenges and sourcing a single service provider to cover all locations can prove to be expensive, restrictive and often problematic. This coupled with a lack of IT staff in each location can lead to extended outages should they occur, which can and should be avoided. In addition the need for more focused solutions for retail customers with engagement through Social Media means the WAN now has to adapted quickly and with agility. The Aequos SD-WAN service is designed to solve common issues in this sector with services delivered seamlessly over best fit combinations of xDSL, 4G LTE and DIA (Direct Internet Access) with granular service levels for each location. </p>

						<p class="grid__text">We work across many Private Sector clients, helping our clients navigate the rapidly changing network landscape as it evolves. Our focus is to streamline the adoption, implementation and operation of next generation WAN services without compromising on core business concerns of cost, security and flexibility. Our in-depth knowledge of WAN products and relationships with key strategic suppliers ensures that a tailored SD-WAN solution is delivered, enabling organisations to focus on their core business.

Organisations that rely on a reliable and high-performance connectivity to their data centre, public cloud, or to SaaS based applications now more than every depend on their Wide Area Network that is robust with predictable performance.
 
Historical WAN architectures with single points of failure, basic load-balancing poor application fail-over strategies and zero application visibility are falling short in meeting the demands of today’s users. 
 
Our SD-WAN services allows for all IT departments to right scale the WAN based on the bandwidth, application criticality and most importantly the end user. Whether the drivers are cost savings or increased network agility we have a range of services that span across multiple vertical sectors. </p>

						<p class="grid__text">SD-WAN enables organisations to augment or replace trusted, but now legacy networks like MPLS, with secure, optimised Internet-enabled connectivity to provide application and user centric networks for your digital and cloud journeys.</p>
						<p class="grid__text">The Aequos SD-WAN optimised network eliminates the application performance problems caused by latency and automatically recovers when any carrier errors occur.</p>
						<p class="grid__text">Our managed SD-WAN service provides the perfect platform for our customers to focus on delivering their business outcomes, safe in the knowledge their WAN is capable of providing the scale, performance and agility for their evolving needs. </p>
						<p class="grid__text">In addition our customers are now demanding deeper insight into application performance, where issues arise and where bottlenecks inhibit performance, particularly if applications have migrated to the clouds.  </p>
						<p class="grid__text">With our SD services Aequos delivers exceptional service experience on, without removing customer control with the embedded benefit of allow real-time changes to respond to business needs. </p>
